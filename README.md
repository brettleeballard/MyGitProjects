# MyGitProjects
Here lies code for my various projects

#Under Webscraping
Will have my webscraping code for the various projects under one directory

#Under FinancialProjects
CompoundCompare.R allows one to compare different compounding terms given the rate and length. It does assume that the length and rate stay consistent over the periods. Will add features to allow for a random change to the rates that will be distributed according to some probability distribution.

#Under SportsRatings
Will use my knowledge of networks and positive stochastic matrix properties to attempt to rate teams through the Google PageRank algorithm using various matrix designs
